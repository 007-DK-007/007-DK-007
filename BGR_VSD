BangdGap Reference VSD
A BGR circuit is a voltage and temperature independent voltage reference circuit that is used in integrated circuits widely for generating refernce voltages for circuits like ADC, DAC, LDO etc.
In such systens typically temperature coeffience needed is 10-50ppm/deg C  0r ~10uV-50uV/deg C for vref=1V and power supply rejection, about 40-60 dB or 1-10mV/V
different basic strustures can be used to create Voltage reference like Resistor divider or  Forward bias p-n junction but they all show huge variation with temperature and supplu voltage.


Operating Principle
Voltage across BJT has negative temp coefficient while theraml voltage(Vt) has positive temp coefficient. If these two are added in a certain proportion, positive and negative temp coefficient cancel each other and temp independent Vreg is obtained which is ~1.2V (bandgap energy of silicon at 0 K)
